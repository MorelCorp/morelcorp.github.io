    dailyStats: Map<date, statistics>,
    moodData: Map<date, moodInfo>,
    lastBackup: ISO8601 timestamp,
    streak: number,
    lastExerciseDate: dateString,
    settings: {
        timerMinutes: number
    },
    dailyPlan: Exercise[],
    completedToday: CompletedExercise[],
    currentFocus: 'general' | 'strength' | 'stretch' | 'articulation'
}
```

#### 2. **Exercise Engine**

- Smart progression algorithm
- Difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Daily plan generation with variety

#### 3. **Timer System**
- Configurable intervals
- State preservation across page reloads
- Audio notifications
- Visual state indicators

#### 4. **Storage Layer**

- Fallback: cookies (4KB limit)
- Export: JSON file download
- Import: File reader API

### Event Flow

```
User Action → Event Handler → State Update → Storage Save → UI Update
                                    ↓
                            Analytics/Tracking
```

## Data Models

### Exercise Model
```typescript
interface Exercise {
    name: string;
    baseReps: number;
    category: 'strength' | 'stretch' | 'articulation';
    unit?: 'reps' | 'seconds' | 'steps' | 'alphabet';
    description: string;
}
```

### Progress Model
```typescript
interface ExerciseProgress {
    currentReps: number;
    successCount: number;
    failCount: number;
}
```

### Daily Statistics
```typescript
interface DailyStats {
    exercises: number;
    reps: number;
    fails: number;
}
```

### Mood Data
```typescript
interface MoodData {
    [date: string]: {
        morning?: {
            energy: 1-5;
            happiness: 1-5;
            time: ISO8601;
        };
        afternoon?: {
            energy: 1-5;
            happiness: 1-5;
            time: ISO8601;
        };
    }
}
```

## Core Features Implementation

### 1. **Smart Exercise Progression**

```javascript
// Success-based progression
if (progress.successCount % 5 === 0) {
    progress.currentReps = Math.min(
        progress.currentReps + 1, 
        exercise.baseReps * 3
    );
}

// Failure-based regression
if (progress.failCount % 3 === 0) {
    progress.currentReps = Math.max(
        Math.floor(progress.currentReps * 0.8), 
        1
    );
}
```

### 2. **Daily Plan Generation**

The algorithm creates balanced workout plans:
1. Filters exercises by focus category
2. Randomizes for variety
3. Balances different muscle groups
4. Adjusts based on yesterday's performance

### 3. **Responsive Timer**

```javascript
// Timer states
IDLE → RUNNING → PAUSED → COMPLETE
         ↓         ↓
      RUNNING ← PAUSED
```

### 4. **Mood Tracking System**

- Triggered at optimal times (9-13h, 14-18h)
- Non-intrusive popup design
- Visual battery indicators for energy
- Emoji-based happiness scale

### 5. **Widget Mode**

Opens minimal window with:
- Reduced chrome (browser-dependent)
- Compact layout
- Hidden navigation
- Top-right positioning

## Storage Strategy

### Data Persistence Hierarchy

1. **Memory (Runtime)**
   - Active state
   - Temporary calculations
   - UI state

2. **localStorage (Primary)**
   - Full state serialization
   - 5-10MB capacity
   - Synchronous API
   - Domain-specific

3. **Cookies (Fallback)**
   - Critical data only
   - 4KB limit per cookie
   - URL encoding required
   - Works on file:// protocol

4. **File Export (Backup)**
   - Complete state export
   - JSON format
   - Manual trigger
   - Weekly reminders

### Storage Optimization

```javascript
// Automatic cleanup of old data
function cleanupOldData() {
    const cutoffDate = new Date();
    cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - 30);
    
    // Remove data older than 30 days
    Object.keys(appState.dailyStats).forEach(date => {
        if (new Date(date) < cutoffDate) {
            delete appState.dailyStats[date];
        }
    });
}
```
